# JavaVapasi

Two years since touching Java in a serious capacity, the lignua franca has called for me.  I must go to my people.

It's a Test Driven approach to using new Java features, from Java 11 to Java 14.

I REALLY TRIED LOVING YOU, JAVA.  BUT THE RIFT IS NOW TOO LARGE TO BRIDGE.  WE SHOULD MOVE ON.  MY NEW LOVE IS KOTLIN.  AND I AM CHEATING ON IT WITH SCALA.  MY HEART DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPACE FOR YOU, JAVA (COZ IT RUNS ON DOCKER).  IT'S NOT YOU IT'S ME.
